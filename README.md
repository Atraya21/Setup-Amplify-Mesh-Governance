# Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance

A Wiki page has been created as a quick start guide to building an Amplify Central Service Mesh on a Kubernetes Cluster.

Read our [setup wiki](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki) to setup Amplify Mesh Governance. 

These steps are based on having a Linux client available to install the required tools to manage an AWS EC2 instance

If you already have the tools needed to manage an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) then skip to Step 2.

[Step 1](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki/Step-1.-Install-required-tools-to-manage-the-AWS-EC2-instance). Install required tools to manage the EC2 instance (AWS CLI, Kubectl, Kops, Helm)

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster within an AWS/EC2 environment then skip to Step 3'

[Step 2](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki/Step-2.-Create-a-Kubernetes-cluster-with-Kops). Create a kops cluster within the AWS/EC2 Kubernetes Environment and setup DNS.

[Step 3](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki/Step-3.-Prepare-Kubernetes-cluster-for-Amplify-Central-Service-Mesh-Agents). Prepare Kubernetes cluster for Amplify Central Service Mesh Agents.

[Step 4](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki/Step-4.-Create-an-Amplify-Central-environment,-add-the-Service-Mesh-to-your-Kubernetes-cluster-installation,-and-finalize-DNS-setup-for-the-Domain-Edge-Gateway). Create an Amplify Central environment, perform Istio/Amplify Central Service Mesh installation, and setup DNS for the Domain Edge Gateway.

[Step 5](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance/wiki/Step-5.--Delete-the-Cluster).  Delete the Cluster.
